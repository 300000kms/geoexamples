This map is based on the [Kartograph software](http://kartograph.org) example [La Bella Italia](http://kartograph.org/showcase/italia/), made by [Gregor Aisch](http://driven-by-data.net/).

I wondered if it was possible to do a similar map, but using [D3js](http://d3js.org/) instead of Kartograph. I think that the result is quite similar (even with the sailing ferry!).

The technical details are in [this post at GeoExamples](http://geoexamples.blogspot.com).
